# Learn to react to Trovao and interrupt it.
# a Sepultra followup will either be a true blockstring or a tight frame trap
# Sepultra is -4 on block. Your character may need to IB it in order to get a throw as a punish.
# 6p is generally great to interrupt Trovao.
# If you want to practice an OS to IB true blockstring Sepultra while also interrupting Trovao,
# I recommend changing the weights to 50-50-0.
