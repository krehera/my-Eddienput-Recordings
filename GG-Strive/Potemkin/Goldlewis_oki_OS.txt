# Anti-Goldlewis oki OS for Potemkin Proof of Concept
# This beats jumping, backdashing, (some) mashing, wakeup super.
# Goal: input 6P early in 5P's hitstop to buffer it,
#    and input 2D after 5P finishes whiffing to beat backdash.
# Humans will want to confirm 5P>6P into 623H or 2D into 236P
# (but this script cannot tell which normal hits).

# Use this script with Potemkin at point-blank to Goldlewis.
# Goldlewis should be set to block after first attack
# and Counterhit options as Random, with 1) Neutral 2) jump 3) backdash.

# first, get the knockdown
# sweep then hammerfall brake to point-blank range

# 5P does not NEED to be perfectly meaty for this to work,
